   	Low power example
   	
DESCRIPTION
===========
  The objective of this demo is to get familiar with the MCU and useful modules Like ADC,
 I2C, UART and LPTMR all of them working on low power mode. 
  The operation mode selected for this demo is LLS this to avoid the reset wake up on deeper 
 operations modes. Basic function the LPTMR will wake up the MCU every 100ms depending on the 
 selected application the Potentiometer or the Accelerometer will be read.
 
  In the case of the potentiometer the MCU must go back to sleep if the read voltage is under 2v. 
 For the accelerometer the MCU goes back to sleep while the tower board is on vertical position 
 (normal tower position). If those conditions are not fulfilled a message must be send thru UART 
 every second and LED D8 on the tower must be toggling. 
 
  Notes:
  Use J8 jumper on pins 1-2 to measure current consumption.
 
CONFIGURATION
=============
  The Workspace contains example with few configurations:


  RAM_64KB 												: The example is loaded into the internal RAM.
  RAM_128KB 											: The example is loaded into the internal RAM.
  FLASH_512KB_PFLASH							: The example is flashed into the embedded flash.
  FLASH_1M_PFLASH									: The example is flashed into the embedded flash.
  FLASH_512KB_PFLASH_128KB_DFLAHS	: The example is flashed into the embedded flash.
  FLASH_512KB_PFLASH_512KB_DFLAHS	: The example is flashed into the embedded flash.
  
COMPATIBILITY
=============

   The example project is compatible with TWR-K21F evaluation board.
  By default the project is configured to use on board PE micro debugger.

GETTING STARTED
===============

  1) Start the IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM.

  2) Connect the on board OpenSDA debugger

  3) Press Ctrl+D or use Download and Debug button to start a debug session
